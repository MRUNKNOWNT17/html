    <h1>About Hacking</h1>

    <p><strong>Who Are Hackers:</strong> Hackers are individuals with advanced knowledge of computer systems and networks. They use their skills to find vulnerabilities, improve security, or exploit weaknesses for various purposes.</p>

    <h2>White Hat Hackers</h2>
    <p>White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, use their skills to strengthen computer security. They work within legal and ethical boundaries, often employed by organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them.</p>

    <h2>Grey Hat Hackers</h2>
    <p>Grey hat hackers fall between white hat and black hat hackers. They may discover and exploit vulnerabilities without proper authorization, but their intentions are not purely malicious. Grey hat hackers might disclose the vulnerabilities to the system owner or public after finding them.</p>

    <h2>Black Hat Hackers</h2>
    <p>Black hat hackers are individuals who exploit their knowledge for malicious purposes. They may engage in activities such as stealing data, spreading malware, or disrupting computer systems. Their actions are typically illegal and against ethical standards.</p>
